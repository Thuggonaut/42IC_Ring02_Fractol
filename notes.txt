Fractal Geometry

Self-similarity:
- The property of an object which looks the same whatever the scale.
- E.g. the snowflake

Objectives:
- MiniLibX graphical library
- Complex numbers notion
- Optimization of graphics
- Event handling

Rendering:
- Mandelbrot, Julia, and a third for the Bonus Part
- Mouse wheel zooms in/out. For Bonus, the zoom follows the mouse position
- Julia: can create different sets by passing different parameters to the ./fractol
- If no parameters are provided, display a list of parameter options before clean exit
- Use atlease three colours
- Bonus: move the view with arrow keys
- Bonus: Make the color range shift

Graphic management:
- Smooth window management
- Pressing ESC or clicking X on the window, closes the window and clean exit
- Must use images of the MiniLibX
